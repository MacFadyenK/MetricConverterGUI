# Metric Converter
The Metric Converter converts a measurement value from one metric unit to another metric unit. This is an expansion of the command line Metric Converter, and now displays a GUI for the user to interact with instead of the command line.

The program requires three different inputs; the starting unit, the ending unit, and the numerical value to be converted. The units for both starting and ending are to be picked from a dropdown combobox. The user will enter the numerical value desired to be converted into a text field box, which only accepts double numbers, not letters.

The user will click the calculate button when ready to calculate the conversion based on the 3 inputs entered, and the result will show below the calculate button.

The user may exit the program by clicking the exit button at the lowest part of the window.
